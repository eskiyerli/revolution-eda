### Tools Menu

`Tools` menu has currently three sub-menus: `Import`,  `Library Browser`, and `Create Stipple`.

### Import Menu

Import Menu is used to import and create symbols for Verilog-a modules and SPICE/Xyce subcircuits.

<img src="assets/importMenus.png" class="image fit" />

#### Verilog-a import

Selecting `Import Verilog-a file…` menu item will display a dialogue
titled `Import a Verilog-a Module File` dialogue. With this dialogue, the user can select, the
file that has a single Verilog-a module, the library the module will be imported, the cell name
and cellview name. Note that cell name field is editable, and thus a new cell name can be input
as well as selecting one of the existing cells. The cellview name field should also be filled.
The important point is that cellview name should include `veriloga` in the string. If a new
symbol is to be created, `Create a new symbol?` checkbox can be checked. A symbol should be
created to be able to use the Verilog-A module in creation of circuit netlists. Note that the
veriloga cellview is in fact a JSON file with a link to Verilog-A module file which is copied to
be under cell directory.

#### Spice Import

Similarly, selecting `Import Spice File…`menu item will lead to a dialogue
titled `Import a Spice Subcircuit File`. Once again, the user can decide if a symbol will be
created for the imported subcircuit. It is advised to create a symbol when the subcircuit is
first imported or the subcircuit pins are changed in any way such as the names or the order.

<img src="assets/importSpice.png"  class="small-image"/>

#### Symbol Creation

While either importing a Verilog-A module or a SPICE subcircuit, a new symbol can be created. If
the new symbol creation checkbox is checked, a new dialogue for naming the to-be-created symbol
is displayed:

<img src="assets/createSymbolViewDialogue.png"  class="small-image" />

Once again, the chosen view name should include `symbol` in the string. Click `OK` and now a new
dialogue to choose pin locations and stub size and the spacing between pins will be displayed:

<img src="assets/createImportSymbolDialogue.png"  class="small-image" />

Our advice is not to change stub length and pin spacing values between symbols to keep
consistent within a design library. Of course, you could assign subcircuit pins as you see fit
between top, left, bottom and right sides. A basic symbol is created ready to be edited further.

<img src="assets/importedSpiceSubcktSymbol.png"  class="image fit" />

This symbol has in this example three attributes [^1]:Attributes will be further explained in
the symbol editor section.

that is needed for the inclusion of a spice subcircuit in SPICE-like netlist:

1. **SpiceNetlistLine**: This attribute is checked when netlisting the symbol in a
   schematic. It defines the template for the netlisting.
2. **SpectreSymbolNetlistLine**: This attribute is used as a template for netlisting when 
   Spectre/Vacask type circuit simulators.
2. **pinOrder**: Pin order defines the order of the pins so that they can replace `@pinList`
   field in `XyceSpiceNetlistLine` in the correct order.
3. **incLine**: The include line is needed so that the simulator can add the subcircuit in the
   netlist.

<img src="assets/importedSpiceSymbolAttributes.png"  class="image fit" />

#### Verilog-A module symbol

The following attributes will be added to a symbol created by importing a Verilog-A module:

1. **XyceVerilogaNetlistLine**: This attribute is the template for the netlisting of this symbol
   when Verilog-a cellview is used.
2. **pinOrder**: Pin order defines the order of pins that replaces `@pinList` field
   in `XyceVerilogaNetlistLine` attribute.
3. **vaModelLine**: This is added to the netlist to define the model for this particular symbol.
   More than one Verilog-A model can refer to same module
   with different model parameters.
4. **vaHDLLine**: This is an extension to Xyce netlist format devised by Revolution EDA. It will
   include a line in final simulation deck that starts with `*.HDL` and points
   to Verilog-A module file location.

Furthermore, this symbol has an attribute that will be used as a model parameter.

1. **td**. An example model parameter can be seen in this particular example, i.e. *td*.
   Depending on whether the parameter is denoted with
   `(*type = "instance", xyceAlsoModel = "yes" *)` in module body, this can be also an instance
   parameter. A user might possibly copy this symbol to another cell/cellview with another model
   parameter attribute value and model name to create another model.

### Library Browser

A typical user will be regularly interacting with `Library Browser` to access design data files.
Library Browser is used to create, open and delete libraries, create, copy and rename cells and
cellviews. Note that Revolution EDA does not have a central database structure. Each library is
in its folder and each cell is a sub-folder under the library folder. Each cellview is a file in
the cell folder. Library folders are denoted by an empty `reveda.lib` file. Library browser
window is designed to be familiar to the experienced custom integrated circuit designers.

<img src="assets/libraryBrowser.png"  class="small-image"/>

Library Browser menubar includes four menus:

1. `Library` This menu has again four items: `Create/Open Lib…`, `Library Editor`, `Close Lib…`,
   and `Update Library…`

     1. A library can be created using `Create/Open Lib...` dialogue, which will open a file
        browser. An
        existing library can be selected or a new folder can be created. Revolution EDA will
        create
        a `reveda.lib` file to denote that it is a valid library. At the moment, it is an empty
        file.
     2. `Library Editor` dialogue can be used to open existing design libraries as well as saving
        library paths in a `library.json` file so that the next time Revolution EDA is started
        the user
        will not have to open the libraries again.
     3. `Close Lib` dialogue is used to close a design library.
     4. `Update Library` will rescan the library paths to reconstruct the

2. `Cell` menu item has two items:

   1. `New Cell…` is used to create a new cell. It starts a dialogue to choose the library cell
      will be placed and its name. In the file system, it creates an empty folder under the
      library folder.
   2. `Delete Cell…` starts a dialogue to choose which cell will be deleted. When a cell is
      deleted, its child cellviews are also deleted. This is not reversible unless a revision
      control system is in place.

3. `View` menu item has three items:

   1. `Create New CellView...` dialogue is used to create a new cell view.

      <img src="assets/createCellViewDialogue.png" class="small-image" />

      The following cellviews are functional at the moment:

      | Cellview   | Tool                                               |
      |------------|----------------------------------------------------||
      | schematic  | Schematic Editor                                   |
      | symbol     | Symbol Editor                                      |
      | config     | Config Editor                                      |
      | veriloga   | Text Editor (opens associated Verilog-A file)      |
      | pcell      | Text Editor (JSON-based parametric cell reference) |
      | spice      | Text Editor (opens associated SPICE file)          |
      | layout     | Layout Editor                                      |
      | revbench   | Simulation & Analysis Environment (requires revedasim plugin) |

   2. `Open CellView...` menu item is used to the start the relevant tool for a cellview.

   3. `Delete CellView…` menu item is used to delete a cellview.

      Both of these items will lead to a dialogue to select the right cellview:

       <img src="assets/deleteCellView.png" class="small-image"  />
