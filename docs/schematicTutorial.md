# Revolution EDA Schematic Editor

The schematic editor is used to instantiate symbols and define the nets that connect them. It serves as the primary entry point for circuit design and integrates seamlessly with the simulation environment. The schematic editor provides advanced features for hierarchical design, netlisting, and simulation setup.

<img src="assets/schematicEditing.png" class="image fit" />

Main functions of the schematic editor are:

1. **Symbol Instantiation**: Place and configure circuit symbols with dynamic parameter support
2. **Instance Properties**: Define instance parameters with Python-based calculations
3. **Net Creation**: Draw wires and define connections with intelligent routing
4. **Pin Definition**: Create hierarchical connection points with direction and type specification
5. **Symbol Generation**: Automatically create symbols from schematic pin definitions
6. **Advanced Netlisting**: Generate netlists with configurable view hierarchies and simulation integration
7. **Simulation Integration**: Direct connection to simulation environment for analysis setup
8. **Configuration Management**: Support for config views and switch/stop view lists

## Symbol Instantiation

A symbol to be placed on the schematic editor is selected by first pressing `i` key or selecting
relevant menu item or toolbar button. A symbol selection dialogue is displayed.

<img src="assets/instanceDialogue.png" class="small-image" />

Symbol selection dialogue only displays the symbol views. Choose the desired symbol and
click `OK` button and click anywhere on the symbol editor window. The symbol will placed at that
point. Note that `[@instName]` label will be converted to an instance name that starts with **I

** and ends with a unique number. If any of other *NLPLabel*s have a default definition, they
will be used. For NLPLabels without a default definition and *PyLabel*s only the definition of
the label will be shown.

<img src="assets/symbolInstating.png" class="image fit" />

Now the select the instance and press `q` button to display ==instance properties== dialogue.
Note that `as` parameter has `asparm()` shown as its value. Because it is defined as PyLabel in the
symbol, once the values for other labels, e.g. *w*, *l*, *nf* and *m* are defined, its value
will be calculated according to the formula defined in `callbacks.py` file.

Note that symbol attributes are also shown under *Instance Attributes* heading. However, the
user cannot edit them using this dialogue, it is just there to inform the designer.

<img src="assets/instancePropertiesDialogue.png" class="image fit" />

At the moment, only instance name, location and angle can be changed as well as instance label
values.

If a schematic is opened but one or more instances cannot be found among the design libraries, a grey box with the missing instance path including library name, cell name and cellview name will be shown.

<img src="assets/missingInstance.png" sclass="image fit" />

## Creating Wires

Wires are used to make connections between instances at pins. The wire creation system includes intelligent routing and connection management.

### Wire Creation Methods
- Press `w` key for wire mode
- Select `Create Wire` from the `Create` menu
- Click the wire toolbar button
- Right-click context menu for quick access

### Wire Behavior
- **Smart Routing**: Automatic orthogonal routing with minimal bends
- **Connection Snapping**: Automatic snapping to pins and existing nets
- **Wire Merging**: Collinear wires automatically merge into single segments
- **Junction Creation**: Automatic solder dot placement at T-junctions

For each net, a net name can be defined using `Net Properties` dialogue. This name will also
propagate all other wires that wire touches.

<img src="assets/netNaming.png" class="image fit" />

If a wire is extended by drawing another wire along its direction, i.e. horizontal or vertical,
those wires will be merged and will become a single wire. If two wires are connected such that
one wire is orthogonal to the other and connects at a mid-point, a solder-dot will be placed and the wire will be split at the solder dot location.

### Net Highlighting

The circuit designers occasionally needs to see which net is connected to other nets as the nets might be connected by name which is not immediately obvious on the schematic.  In that case, the user can select `Tools->Highlight Net` menu item. It is a checkable menu item, and as long as it is checked, net highlighting mode will be effective.

<img src="assets/netHighlightingMenu.png" class="small-image" />

If the mouse cursor hovers on a net, all the nets connected to that net will be highlighted including visual paths connecting centre points of the nets:

<img src="assets/highlightedNets.png" class="image fit" />

## Creating Pins

Like symbol pins, schematic pins define the connection points for the circuit in a hierarchical
design. A pin can be created by pressing `p` key or selecting relevant menu item or toolbar
button. Pins can have three directions:

1. Input
2. Output
3. InOut

At the moment, *Pin Type* definition is not used.

<img src="assets/schematicPinAdd.png" class="image fit" />

Schematic pins will snap to nets if any nets are connected. If the pin is moved, the connected nets will rearrange to keep the connection.

<img src="assets/netPinSnappingStart.png" class="small-image" />
<img src="assets/netPinSnappingResult.png" class="small-image" />


## Creating Text

Texts can be placed on the schematics. All monospaced fonts on the system can be used. Software will try to find the closest font if it can not find the exact font when the schematic were to be used in another system. Text Entry dialogue allows the all the available style and sizes of a font to be selected.

<img src="assets/schematicTextEntry.png" class="small-image" />
<img src="assets/schematicTextResult.png" class="small-image" />

Text orientation can also be changed to rotate the text. 

<img src="assets/schematicTextOrient.png" class="small-image" />

If a text is selected and its property window is brought up using *q* key, all these properties can also be changed later.

## Creating Symbols

A symbol for a schematic can be created automatically using `Create Symbol` menu item.
Revolution EDA first verify the name of the symbol cell view. As explained earlier, the cell
view name should include *symbol* in the text. To generate a symbol for a schematic, make sure that all the pins for the symbol defined using schematic pins in the schematic. Then, select `Create->Create Symbol...` menu item which will bring up symbol creation dialogue:

<img src="assets/createSymbolDialogue.png" class="small-image" />

Once the symbol view name is entered, click `OK`. If a view with the same name exists, the
Revolution EDA will confirm the designer wants to overwrite that view. If the input to that
dialogue is also `OK`, a new dialogue will be displayed:

<img src="assets/symbolPropertiesDialogue.png" class="small-image" />

The initial placement of pins is according to their directions. The designer is free to change
the location of pins. It is advisable to keep *Stub Length* and *Pin spacing* values to keep a
consistent look. Once the designer is satisfied the pin locations and symbol geometry
parameters, he/she can proceed to creating a symbol view. The symbol view will be opened in
another window. A library browser will also show a symbol view is added to the relevant cell.

<img src="assets/createdSymbolEditor.png" class="image fit" />

We have already explained which attributes are necessary for netlisting a symbol depending on the symbol, veriloga or spice cellview, if they exist, would be used for netlisting when needed.

## Simulation Integration

The schematic editor provides seamless integration with the simulation environment through the **revedasim** plugin:

### Direct Simulation Access
- **Revbench Integration**: Create simulation testbenches directly from schematics using the `revbench` cellview type
- **Analysis Setup**: Configure DC, AC, transient, noise, and harmonic balance analyses
- **Parameter Sweeps**: Set up multi-dimensional parameter variations
- **Interactive Selection**: Click on nets and components to auto-populate simulation fields
- **Plugin-Based**: Requires the `revedasim` plugin to be installed

### Enhanced Netlisting
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Full support for complex design hierarchies with proper view selection
- **View Selection**: Intelligent view selection based on switch/stop view lists
- **Config View Support**: Advanced configuration management for large designs through config cellviews
- **Background Operation**: Netlisting runs in background thread pool without blocking the editor
- **Xyce Simulator Support**: Native support for Xyce circuit simulator netlisting format

## Creating Netlists

Netlist creation can be done through `Simulation` menu and `Create Netlist` menu item. It will
start an `Export Netlist` dialog. Depending on the availability of *schematic* and *config*
views, there could be more than one option to choose for `view` combobox. Here we will be
concentrating on using *Switch view list* field to control the netlisting process. Once we
explain the *config* view and the associated editor, we will also touch use of config views in
netlisting process.

<img src="assets/exportNetlistDialogue.png" class="small-image"/>

In this dialogue, the view to be netlisted is *schematic*. Switch view list is the order of
preference in netlisting a cell. If a cell has both veriloga and schematic views, *schematic*
view will be preferred and *veriloga* will not be used. Stop view list defines the views that netlister should not go down in hierarchy. At the moment, only "symbol" view entry is valid.

*Export directory* field determines the parent folder name for the simulations. It is normally
entered at *Options* menu of main window.

<img src="assets/revedaOptionsDialogue.png" class="small-image"/>

However it could be changed at *export netlist* field as well. However, it ==will not be saved==
in the Revolution EDA configuration file unlike the entries in *Options* dialogue.

When `OK` button is clicked, Revolution EDA performs a full hierarchical netlisting of the circuit with the following enhancements:

### Advanced Netlisting Features
- **Background Operation**: Netlisting runs in background thread pool, allowing continued work
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Full support for complex design hierarchies with proper view selection
- **Configuration Support**: Integration with config views for advanced design management
- **Output Management**: Organized output structure under simulation path directory
- **File Naming**: Consistent naming convention `cellName_viewName.cir`
- **Thread Pool**: Uses configurable thread pool for efficient processing

### Configuration Views
Config views provide advanced control over netlisting:
- **View Mapping**: Define which views to use for each cell in the hierarchy
- **Switch Lists**: Specify view preference order for automatic selection
- **Stop Lists**: Control netlisting depth and prevent unwanted expansion
- **Design Variants**: Support multiple configurations of the same design

The circuit netlist will be structured as follows:

```verilog
**********************************************************************************
** Revolution EDA CDL Netlist
** Library: anotherLibrary
** Top Cell Name: example2

.END
.MODEL resModel res R = 1
*.HDL /home/eskiyerli/OneDrive_reveda/Projects/RevEDA/exampleLibraries/analogLib/resVa/res.va
```

Note that verilog-a model is used for the resistor, because `veriloga` view is before `symbol` view in the *switch view list* field. Let's now reverse their positions and check the output netlist:

```verilog
**********************************************************************************
** Revolution EDA CDL Netlist
** Library: anotherLibrary
** Top Cell Name: example2
** View Name: schematic
** Date: 2024-03-16 21:34:45.647943
**********************************************************************************
*.GLOBAL gnd!

XI0 example1 net0 intNoe
.SUBCKT example1 INP  OUT
RI1 net0 drain 1k
MI7 drain INP gnd! gnd! nmos w=2u l=0.18u nf=2  as=560n m=1
CI8 OUT drain 1p 0
CI5 net0 drain 1p 0
.ENDS
XI1 example1 intNoe net1
RI4 net1 gnd! 1k
VI2 net0 gnd! PULSE( 1 1m 1k 0 0 0  )
.END
```

Now the resistor is netlisted as a symbol using the attributes relevant to symbol netlisting, i.e. `SpiceNetlistLine` and `pinOrder`.

### Ignoring Instances

Circuit designers might need netlisting process to ignore some components depending on the testbench purpose. It is very easy to mark instances to be ignored in the netlisting by selecting `ignore` item in instance context menu. Just select the instance you want to be ignored in the netlisting process and click right mouse button to bring up instance context menu:

<img src="assets/instanceContextMenu.png" alt="Instance Context Menu" class="image fit"/>

`ignore` menu item is used to toggle if this device instance will be ignored during netlisting. If the user selects it once, a red cross on the instance symbol is drawn. If the user selects an ignored instance and selects the `ignore` menu item, the red-cross will be removed and symbol instance will be netlisted normally. 

<img src="assets/instanceIgnore.png" alt="Schematic Instance Ignore" class="image fit" />

Netlister will report the ignored block with a comment as shown in the following netlist for the schematic above, helping the design engineer to make sure that the correct netlist is being used for simulations.

```

## Hierarchy Traversing

Revolution EDA provides convenient hierarchy traversal functionality. A design engineer can start editing a schematic and easily navigate to edit the schematic or symbol of an instantiated component. This hierarchy traversal maintains the design context and allows seamless navigation through the design hierarchy. The function is available for schematic, symbol, and layout views.

Select a symbol, and do one of these:

- Press on `Go Down` button on the toolbar, 
- Select `Edit->Hierarchy->Go Down` menu item, 
- Press `Shift+E` key combination,
- Right click on mouse to pop up the context menu and select `Go Down` entry

<img src="assets/goDownHier.png" class="image fit" />

A dialogue titled `Go Down Hierarchy` will pop up. Depending on the cell, you can choose `Symbol` or `Schematic` view to open in either *edit* or *read-only* mode.

<img src="assets/goDownDialogue.png" class="image fit" />

After opening a symbol for editing, the designer can save the symbol after finishing the edits and then choose the `Go Up` button on the toolbar to close the window and return to the parent schematic. The changes in the symbol will be automatically reflected in the original schematic.
